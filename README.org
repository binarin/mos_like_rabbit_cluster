* First scenario I want to test

  - Setup 3 node cluster
  - Set ha-policy to all
  - Declare single exchange / queue for rpc
  - Start substantial amount of RPC servers that consume from that queue (they should randomly connect to one node from cluster)
  - Start substantial amount of RPC clients
    - Connect to random server
    - Declare private reply exchange / queue
    - Send rpc-s with random delay
  - Start some nemesis
  - Start process which continiously does 'list_channels'
